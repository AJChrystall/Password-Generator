# Basic Use of This Code
This code is too randomly generate a password. 

# My Code Description 
This code generates a password based on the length and character sets chosen by the user. The generatePassword() function takes in a password length, and four boolean variables indicating whether the password should include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical values, and special characters. It creates a charset string based on the character sets that are selected by the user, and uses this string to generate a random password of the desired length. If the user does not select any character sets, the function returns an empty string.

The writePassword() function prompts the user to input the desired password length and then uses confirm() prompts to ask the user which character sets should be included in the password. It then calls the generatePassword() function to generate a password based on the user's selections, and displays the password in the HTML input field with the id "password". The event listener attached to the "Generate Password" button triggers the writePassword() function when the button is clicked.
